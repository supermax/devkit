# 🎮 DevKit — The AI-Powered Game-as-a-Service Platform

> One platform. Every tool. Smarter, faster game development with AI.

---

## 🌍 Vision

DevKit empowers game creators of all sizes — from solo devs to large studios — with an AI-native platform to **build, scale, and manage games** faster than ever.  
We merge **world generation, backend infrastructure, AI/ML**, and **low-code tools** into one modular GaaS engine.

---

## 🚀 Why Now?

- ⚙️ Game development is still expensive, manual, and fragmented  
- 🔥 Studios want AI for worldbuilding, economy tuning, QA, NPCs — but it's hard to integrate  
- 🚀 DevKit unlocks **creativity, speed, and automation** for the next generation of games
